# Cache-Allocation-Project

The initiators of this new version are Abdel-Aziz BINGUITCHA-FARE, Théo BOUGANIM, under the supervision of Assoc. Prof. Andrea Araldo, at Télécom SudParis.

The purpose of this project is to implement reinforcement learning algorithms to study resource allocation problems, that is how to share 
limited resources out among several agents.

Such problems do occur in various fields, be it economics, investments, advertising, production systems, and so on. 
This project revolves around network operators allocating their caches to content providers.
